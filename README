All files in this repository are (c) 1994-2002
by Matthias Urlichs <smurf@noris.de>.

Usage: The b.* programs are helper scripts for using Bitkeeper with
a central repository, pointed to by the environment variable
"BK_REPOSITORY". They're documented in German; sorry about that.  ;-)

All of these programs accept "-h" for a help text. "-d XX" is the
repository name and "-v YY" the version/branch/whatever.

Thus, "b.new -s -d foobar -v test" would create a new single-user
BK repository at '$BK_REPOSITORY/foobar-test'.

If BK_REPOSITORY is a URL (and not simply a local directory), all
reads of the remote repository are cached in /var/cache/bk.

The CVS import tool ('b.cvs') supports branches and incremental updates
from an external CVS repository. It will call "bk renametool" when there
are both deleted and new files.


YOUR RIGHTS:

You may use those programs (duh ;-) and make local modifications (of
course). Please send all feature improvements back to me. You may not
redistribute these programs outside your organization, nor would you
want to. ;-)  You may not use them for repositories which are not Open
Source without talking to me first -- hint: If you save money by using
these programs, or ideas from them, I want some of it.

You may not use this code if you plan to gain monetary or other
compensation from me in case anything goes wrong. In other words,
NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER.
